The solution involves either defining the `square` function within the module, or importing a module that contains a definition for `square`. 

```haskell
-- bugSolution.hs

square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

main = do
  let x = 10
  print (square x) 
```

Alternatively, if `square` is defined in another module (e.g., `Math`), you would need to import it:

```haskell
-- Assuming a module named Math with a square function
import Math

main = do
  let x = 10
  print (square x)
```
